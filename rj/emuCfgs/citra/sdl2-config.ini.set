# Escape characters $0 (for ':'), $1 (for ',') and $2 (for '$') can be used in values

# for button input, the following devices are available:
#  - "keyboard" (default) for keyboard input. Required parameters:
#      - "code": the code of the key to bind
#  - "sdl" for joystick input using SDL. Required parameters:
#      - "joystick": the index of the joystick to bind
#      - "button"(optional): the index of the button to bind
#      - "hat"(optional): the index of the hat to bind as direction buttons
#      - "axis"(optional): the index of the axis to bind
#      - "direction"(only used for hat): the direction name of the hat to bind. Can be "up", "down", "left" or "right"
#      - "threshold"(only used for axis): a float value in (-1.0, 1.0) which the button is
#          triggered if the axis value crosses
#      - "direction"(only used for axis): "+" means the button is triggered when the axis value
#          is greater than the threshold; "-" means the button is triggered when the axis value
#          is smaller than the threshold
