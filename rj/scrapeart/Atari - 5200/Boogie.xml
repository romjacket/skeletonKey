<Name>Boogie</Name>
	<Plot>As the name implies, Boogie is not a game but a music demo.  This prototype displays the 5200 splash screen while continuously playing a "boogie" tune.  The music is somewhat interesting, and shows off the 5200's music abilities fairly well.  It's unknown whether this prototype was made simply as a learning tool, or if some kind of music game was being planned.</Plot>
